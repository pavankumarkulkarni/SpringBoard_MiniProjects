Data Science Course: Machine Learning 
Mini-Project : Clustering
Learning Objective
●	Learn the basic machine learning algorithms such as unsupervised Learning: K-Means clustering.
●	Practice applying machine learning algorithms to real data. 
Criteria	Meets Expectations
Completion	●	The code runs successfully.
Process and understanding	●	The submission shows that the correct solutions to all of the questions, as well as the correct visualizations, have been applied and that the answers to all the questions are detailed

●	The submission demonstrates a good understanding of both the problem statement, as well as the underlying tools and methods.

●	The student has applied best ML modeling practices.
Presentation	●	The project is delivered in a Jupyter notebook, uploaded to GitHub.
●	The project doesn't contain any unnecessary printouts.

Excellence: Publication quality visualizations are created. Certain methods are written from scratch (for example, for Cross Validation), the optional exercises are solved.
